	I spent a lot of my childhood shuttling back and forth between the <b>United States</b> and <b>China</b>, splitting my time between small suburban cities around Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the mega-cities of Beijing and Shanghai. After settling down in Brookfield, Wisconsin in my teenage years, I fell in love with in astronomy and physics around the age of 17 after reading a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Eternity_to_Here:_The_Quest_for_the_Ultimate_Theory_of_Time">From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a>. This led me to move again in 2011 to Boston, Massachusetts, to pursue my studies at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/"><b>Harvard University</b></a>, where I completed my Bachelor's Degree with Honors jointly in Astrophysics and Physics in 2015.
      </p>
	      
      <p>
	During my time at Harvard, I participated in multiple research projects across a wide range of topics in astronomy. What struck me across these projects was the extent to which so much of science depended on robust statistical analysis and computational methods, both in terms of generating underlying the data products as well as characterizing the significance of any particular findings. This led me to shift my research focus to the intersection of astrophysics, statistics, and computer science, namely <b>astrostatistics</b> and <b>data science</b>. As part of this shift, I moved again in 2015 to Kashiwa, Japan to work with <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/about_department/people/faculty/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=alexie">Alexie Leauthaud</a> and <a href="http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=kbundy">Kevin Bundy</a> at the <a href="http://www.ipmu.jp/"><b>Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</b></a> (Kavli IPMU). This provided me with an invaluable opportunity to start my journey from astornomy and physics into statistics and comptuer science while I worked on improving <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/science/photometric-redshfits/">photometric redshifts</a> for the <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/">Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program</a> (HSC SSP) Survey.
      </p>
	
      <p>
	In 2016 I returned to Boston to pursue my graduate studies in the <a href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Astronomy</a> at Harvard. I received by my Master's and Doctoral Degrees in 2020 under the joint supervision of <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink/">Doug Finkbeiner</a>, <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/agoodman">Alyssa Goodman</a>, and <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein/">Daniel Eisenstein</a>. My final thesis, <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365889"><b>"Mapping the Milky Way in the Age of Gaia"</b></a>, was only possible thanks to the broad range of expertise provided by my advisers and collaborators and the many exciting opportunities available through interdisciplinary research areas such as astrostatistics.
      </p>
	
      <p>
	Following my PhD, I moved again to Toronto, Canada in 2020 to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html">Gwen Eadie</a> (the first astrostatistics professor jointly appointed in both a statistics department and physics/astronomy department in Canada!) as a <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/2019-2020-eng.html">Banting Fellow</a> and <a href="https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/people/dunlap-fellows/">Dunlap Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"><b>University of Toronto</b></a>. In 2022, I was extremely fortunate to be able to join her (and also not have to move again!) as the second <b>Assistant Professor in Astrostatistics</b> jointly appointed between the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">Department of Statistical Sciences</a> and the <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/">David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics</a> at the University of Toronto. And that's where things are today!
      </p>

      <p>
	Outside of work, I mostly enjoy hanging out at home or going on walks with my wife and our two dogs (pictured below). I also watch way too much anime and play way too many video games, and have an supremely unhealthy love of junk food and soda (pun intended).
